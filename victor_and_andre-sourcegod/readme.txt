    You are the hand-programmer god of the code. Your task is to keep the source-
    code safe against bugs. When you are light blue, your normal form, you may
    possess a programmer (the stick man) and go around. Use the directional arrows
    or the numeric keyboard to move your programmer. The programmer may attack
    enemies using SPACE. This fixes code destroyed by bugs too.

    You can free a programmer from possession using ENTER.

    Sometimes you may able to drag and drop programmers around. To do that press
    the key "2" in the alphanumeric keyboard, now you are brown. You may click in
    a programmer and drag him to other place. However, this is a very limited
    resource, so use wisely.

    Pressing "3", you will become green. In this mode, you may attack the enemies
    directly. However, this is again a limited resource.

    To go back to blue, press "1".
